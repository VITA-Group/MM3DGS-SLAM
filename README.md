## Framework

![overview](./docs/static/images/framework.jpg)

As shown above, we present the framework for Multi-modal 3D Gaussian Splatting for SLAM. We utilize inertial measurements, RGB images, and depth measurements to create a SLAM method using 3D Gaussians. Through the effort of integrating multiple modalities, our SLAM method performs with high tracking and mapping accuracy.

## Dataset

To access our dataset, visit [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/neel1302/UT-MM/tree/main). To see videos of the content, please visit our [[Project Page]](https://vita-group.github.io/MM3DGS-SLAM/).

Combined, the datasets contain 8387 images, 2796 LiDAR scans, and 27971 IMU measurements. The following is a quick overview of the topics that can be found within each bag file:

```
/vrpn_client_node/Jackal_Latest/pose   : geometry_msgs/PoseStamped (Pose Coordinates, 100hz)
/realsense/color/image_raw/compressed  : sensor_msgs/CompressedImage (RGB Image, 30hz)
/realsense/depth/image_rect_raw        : sensor_msgs/Image (Depth Image, 30hz)
/microstrain/imu/data                  : sensor_msgs/Imu (Imu Measurements, 100hz)
/ouster/points                         : sensor_msgs/PointCloud2 (LiDAR Point Clouds, 10hz)
```

To visualize the dataset, ROS is needed. Some scripts are provided in the UT_MM_Scripts directory.

```
roscore

rosrun rviz rviz -d UT_MM_Scripts/configs/jackal.rviz

rqt --clear-config --perspective-file UT_MM_Scripts/configs/rqt_plots.perspective

rosbag play --clock *.bag --pause

python3 imu_preintegration.py
```
